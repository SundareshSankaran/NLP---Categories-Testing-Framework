Implement processes based on this custom step (and custom reporting templates provided in the same repo) to assess the current progress of your model.\n\nAn example application is to run this step in parallel with your NLP model development and visualize assessment output using SAS Visual Analytics.\n",

This \"disables\" execution of the custom step.\n\nTo \"disable\" this step, run the following code upstream:\n\n%global _nctf_run_trigger;\n%let _nctf_run_trigger =0;\n\nTo \"enable\" this step again, run the following (it's assumed that this has already been set as a global variable):\n\n%let _nctf_run_trigger =1;\n\nIMPORTANT: Be aware that disabling this step means that none of its main execution code will run, and any  downstream code which was dependent on this code may fail.
